## About
* This is for educational purposes only and I don't encorage using hacking
* This is not shared app or ready to use application, it is just example for how to use memory reader and to know how games working
* There are many ways to avoid ban but I will not talk about them in this tutorial
* Using this code as it is without any protection, may cause ban for your account and it is only on your responsibility

## My work
* Radar points for enemies
* Updating offsets for latest version of the game
* Updating items name and adding the neo
* Different color for each player (in the same team) for enemy line and radar point
* Menu controller for every single item to control its appearence
* Different color for each item type (weapons, vehicles, throwables ... etc.)
* Fix issues to perform speed and smooth working for the application
* And more

## Working on
* Dead player box and airdrop items list
* Car fuel and health
* Write on memory (Fast landing speed, Auto aim, Magic bullet, Car speed, Flying car, High jump and Fast running)
